This is a visualization that was done by a boy at SQIICT from the Data Science Week bootcamp titled Think Like A data scientist. The boy came with his laptop. But a lower version that Power Bi couldn't installed. I was at the situation with him so I offered him my pc to be able to gain something meaningful from the bootcamp.
